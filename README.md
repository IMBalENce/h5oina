# Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis HDF5 File Specification

This repository contains the specification for the Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis HDF5 file format (_.h5oina_).
This file format can be used to export EBSD acquisitions and combined EBSD/EDS acquisitions.
The file format is largely influenced by the H5EBSD file format developed by Jackson et al. (2014) [[doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2193-9772-3-4)].
It is using the [Hierarchical Data Format 5](http://www.hdfgroup.org) file format library, which has several implementations in different programming languages.
